# network_recon
Created this tool as a part of assignment for "Scripting for Cybersecurity" module taught in CIT.

This tool can be used for performing reconnaissance on the host present on the network.
There are two modes: 
1. Active - Pings every host on the network and prints the IP address of the host which replies
2. Passive - Maps ip address and their MAC address and prints it in a table
